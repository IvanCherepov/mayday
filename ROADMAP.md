## Upcoming features

To better support users we are scoping some additional features to add to Mayday
including the following:

  * Optional direct upload to object storage of mayday archives
  * Automated processing of uploaded archives for common errors

These features will likely be implemented through other pieces of software which
may be broken into other repositories.
